# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Dec 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: CSS from scratch

**Thoughts:** I was doing well with css until I was introduced to bootstrap. Now it's time to go back and get a solid foundation with CSS resposiveness and animation. building a new portfolio while applying css styling from scratch and hopefully animation as well later on

**Link to work:** [just some cleaning and resetting css](https://github.com/samergain/animations/commit/bce93aaa73fd0ccd77e5cabab18fc1e98019ee36)
